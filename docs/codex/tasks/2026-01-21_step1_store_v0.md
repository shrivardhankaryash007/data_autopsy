# Task: Step 1 - MeasurementStore v0 repo skeleton

- Date: 2026-01-21
- Status: completed
- Owner: codex

## Goal

Stand up the repository skeleton and implement the initial MeasurementStore v0 along with tests and a notebook stub.

## Prompt

Create docs/codex/tasks/2026-01-21_step1_store_v0.md using docs/codex/tasks/TEMPLATE.md. Fill it completely, including the exact prompt text of this Codex task verbatim. Then implement Step 1: repo skeleton + MeasurementStore v0 + tests + notebook stub (or create the notebook in a minimal way). Run ruff check . and pytest -q. Open a PR.

## Plan

1. Create repo scaffolding, documentation template, and the filled task entry.
2. Implement MeasurementStore v0 with tests and a notebook stub.
3. Run ruff and pytest, then summarize the work for the PR.

## Steps

### Step 1

- Create docs/codex/tasks/TEMPLATE.md and this task document.
- Add the Python package skeleton, MeasurementStore v0, and tests.
- Add a minimal notebook stub for the store.

### Step 2

- Run ruff check . and pytest -q.
- Prepare the PR summary and metadata.

## Definition of Done

- Repository skeleton, MeasurementStore v0, tests, and notebook stub are present.
- Ruff and pytest complete successfully.
- PR summary is prepared.

## Notes

- MeasurementStore v0 is intentionally small and in-memory to support iteration.
